IMPORTANT! 

⚠️ Extended Dev Packs (Patches or updates) are hosted on MediaFire, uploaded to GitHub, **then DELETED.**
Dev packs **will not** be restored, minor patches will be made to fix things. If a mod is broken, kindly open an issue and I'll do what I can to fix it.
I will post direct links to dev packs that are currently under construction if asked. These are **VIEW ONLY**.
