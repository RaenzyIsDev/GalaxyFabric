IMPORTANT! 

‚ö†Ô∏è Extended Dev Packs (Patches, updates, and reccommended textures) are hosted on GDrive, uploaded to GitHub, **then DELETED.**
Dev packs **will not** be restored, minor patches will be made to fix things. If a mod is broken, kindly open an issue and I'll do what I can to fix it. I kinda want to be one and done w/ updates ngl.

I will post direct links to dev packs that are currently under construction if asked. (You could donate to my patreon\kofi üôè and I'll try to give you playable packs right away) These are **VIEW ONLY**.

uhh thats all for now?
